    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Physics Engineering student with a strong focus on mathematical modeling, computational physics, and numerical simulation applied to real-world engineering and research challenges. My experience includes developing physics-based models using Lagrangian mechanics, differential geometry, and advanced numerical methods, as well as designing automation and analysis tools for industrial simulation workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
        My work spans the computational modeling of mechanical systems, digital twins, and optical and geometric simulations, alongside data-driven approaches implemented in Python, Julia, Matlab, and scientific computing frameworks. I am particularly interested in the intersection of physics, optimization, and artificial intelligence, with applications in advanced simulation, photonics, and quantitative problem-solving across engineering and industry.
